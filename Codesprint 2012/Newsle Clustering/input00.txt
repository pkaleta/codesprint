Each satellite in turn fired its main engine to slow it and put it in an elliptical orbit around the lunar sphere.\n\n    This orbit has a period of 11.5 hours and must now gradually be reduced in size and circularised before any science can begin.\n\n    A series of further burns on each spacecraft should achieve this goal by March.\n\n    The twins will then map the small variations in gravity across the lunar surface from an altitude of 55km.\n\n    These gravity differences are the result of an uneven distribution of mass. Obvious examples at the Moon's surface include big mountain ranges or deep impact basins, but even inside the lunar body the rock will be arranged in an irregular fashion, with some regions being denser than others.\n\n    All this will have a subtle influence on the pull of gravity sensed by the over-flying spacecraft.\n\n    The Grail twins will make their measurements by carrying out a carefully calibrated pursuit of each other.\n\n    As the lead spacecraft flies through the uneven gravity field, it will experience small accelerations or decelerations. The second spacecraft, following some 100-200km behind, will detect these disturbances as very slight changes in the separation between the pair - deviations that are not much more than the width of a human red blood cell.\n\n    When the gravity map is combined with comparable-resolution topographical information showing the surface highs and lows, scientists should be able to deduce the Moon's probable internal structure and composition. This is fundamental knowledge that will play into theories of how the lunar body formed and how it has changed through time.\n\n    \"We believe the Moon formed from the impact of a Mars-sized object into Earth, but we understand little really of how this happened and how the [lunar body] cooled off after the violent event,\" said Dr Zuber. And she described as \"shocking\", the continued inability of science to explain why the rugged far-side of the Moon looks so different from that of the nearside with its great swathe of dark volcanic plains, or maria.\n\n    \"Given that we've sent so many missions that have studied the outside of the Moon, it seems that the answer is not on the surface. The answer is locked in the interior,\" she said.\n\n    One fascinating idea to emerge recently that will come under scrutiny from Grail is the suggestion that the highlands on the far-side were formed as a result of a low-velocity impact by a second, much smaller moon. A research team published a paper in the journal Nature last August that showed how such an impact could have added material to the crust on the far hemisphere.\n\n    It made very clear predictions that the Grail data will be able to test.\n\n    Grail's mapping phase will last for 82 days until early June. The Moon then goes into shadow, into eclipse, behind the Earth.\n\n    If the satellites can survive the hours of darkness on their batteries, it is likely they will be tasked with a second mapping cycle in the second half of 2012.\n\n    This would be at a much reduced altitude, perhaps as low as 25km from the surface. Getting lower would improve the resolution of the gravity maps yet again, and enable scientists to study even the structure of relatively small, shallow craters.\n\n    \"Simple bowl-shaped craters, which on the Moon have diameters up to about 15km or so, are the most common landforms on the surfaces of the terrestrial planets, and this is a whole new area of science that will open up to us if we're able to do the extended mission,\" Dr Zuber explained.\n\n    Grail is an acronym for Gravity Recovery and Internal Laboratory. The satellites will be given more engaging names than just A and B once the weekend's orbit insertion is confirmed. The names are being chosen via a public competition.\n    ", "id": 4, "title": "Nasa's gravity twins now circling Moon"}, {"content": "On New Year's Eve, the first of two NASA spacecraft fired its engine and maneuvered into orbit around the moon after a three-month, 2.5-million-mile journey. Its twin followed suit 25 hours later.\n\n    Both GRAIL A and GRAIL B -- washing-machine sized satellites designed to map the surface and interior of the moon -- are now zipping around the moon in an elliptical orbit, with GRAIL B trailing 10 miles behind its twin. (GRAIL stands for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory.) Over the next two months, they'll be moving into a low-altitude circular orbit at a distance of 35 miles from the moon's surface, preparing to start science observations on March 8.\n\n    The twin probes are designed to measure changes in the moon's gravitational field at extremely high accuracy. The mass of geological formations like mountains, valleys or deep basins, creates a slight gravitational pull or push on an orbiting object. So do materials and forces beneath the lunar surface that can't be seen on a topographical map.\n\n    \"If you're orbiting the moon and you fly over a mountain, the spacecraft will literally sense additional pull,\" said Sami Asmar, deputy project scientist on the GRAIL mission. \"A mountain has more mass than its surroundings. If you fly over a valley, you literally sense less gravity, you sense a gravity low. We'll try to correlate that with the topography.\"\n\n    Changes in gravity caused by these structures and forces will be transmitted as radio signals between the two spacecraft and beamed back to Earth.\n\n    \"Bodies like the Earth and the moon are not homogeneous, they're not all with an equal distribution of mass and chemical elements,\" Asmar said. \"They vary, and we want to know how they vary to understand the interior structure.\"\n\n    The moon's far side, for example, is rougher and more mountainous than its near side, which is smoother with more dips and valleys.\n    The hope is that these measurements will help answer some fundamental questions about the moon. For example, does it have an iron core and a surrounding liquid layer, like Earth? And if so, how big is the core and its mantle, and how massive?\n\n    The really interesting findings, he said, will occur when a gravitational pull is detected over a flat area, suggesting something underneath the surface, such as a buried asteroid or comet,or magma flow from the moon's interior.\n\n    One recent theory is that Earth once had two moons that combined during a collision, a possible explanation for why the far side of the moon is so much lumpier than the side that we see.\n\n    \"It's an elegant theory, one that would be neat to shed light on,\" Asmar said.", "id": 5, "title": "Twin NASA Probes Circling Moon, Hoping to Answer Questions About Core"}]
